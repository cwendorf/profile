### Professional Interests

Broadly speaking, I am interested in statistical methods, social and cultural psychology, and the scholarship of teaching and learning. Of course, these interests are not mutually exclusive; in fact, most of my work spans more than one of these categories.

- **Statistics and Research Methods:** Confidence intervals; effect sizes; structural equation modeling; multilevel modeling
- **Social and Cultural Psychology:** Justice, fairness, and morality; social and political values; cultural and evolutionary psychology
- **Scholarship of Teaching and Learning:** Social psychology of education; student evaluations of teaching; faculty development

### Available Materials

I believe in clear and open practices in higher education. My summary teaching materials, links to my research publications and student independent projects, and portals to my open source statistics resources are all available on this website.
